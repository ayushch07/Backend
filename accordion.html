            What is a HTML simple definition? Introduction to HTML HTML stands
            for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language
            for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
            HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the
            browser how to display the content.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media. CSS is among the core languages of the open web and
            is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
            Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification
            was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
            recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
            CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is
            now CSS without a version number.

        <div class="body-of-content">
          <div class="content">
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time
            compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles. JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include
            runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
            variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection
            (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery
            (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved
            through toString()). This section is dedicated to the JavaScript
            language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or
            other host environments. For information about APIs that are
            specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM. The standards
            for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262)
            and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification
            (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to
            document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new
            ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers,
            documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new
            features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4,
            and is usually before the spec is officially published. Do not
            confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â€” JavaScript
            is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
            trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other
            countries. However, the two programming languages have very
            different syntax, semantics, and use. JavaScript documentation of
            core language features (pure ECMAScript, for the most part) includes
            the following: The JavaScript guide The JavaScript reference For
            more information about JavaScript specifications and related
            technologies, see JavaScript technologies overview.
